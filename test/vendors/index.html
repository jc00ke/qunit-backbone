    We are a firm that starts with Energy Audits and small and mid size energy retrofits. We go all the way to complete energy remodels and also do new buildings.
    Buildings are responsible for 40% of national energy consumption and 70% of total electrical consumption.  They emit 50% of CO2 emissions. Changing the way energy is used by buildings has tremendous potential to reduce our national energy crisis.  Q+ buildings reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling by 90%. This can be achieved in almost any climate zone for both new and retrofit projects.

    Sustainable Energy Partners (SEP) is a nationally recognized clean energy consulting firm. SEP is uniquely qualified to provide design and consulting services for the commercial and multi-family residential sectors.
    SEP can provide three levels of detail for an energy audit:
    Walk-through Assessment: Analyze energy bills and a brief visual survey of the facility. Identifies no-cost and low-cost opportunities.
    Energy Survey and Analysis: A more detailed analysis is conducted, including a breakdown of how energy is used within the building. Potential capital-intensive opportunities are identified in the final report for further research and analysis. This is the typical level of audit.
    Detailed Analysis of Capital-Intensive Modifications (Investment-grade Audit): This analysis focuses on capital-intensive opportunities and provides a higher degree of monitoring, data collection, and engineering analysis. The report includes detailed cost and savings information with a high-level of confidence sufficient for major capital investment decisions, and may include a reasonable timeline for implementation of each recommendation.
